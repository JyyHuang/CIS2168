Exercise 5.3. Suppose node is a reference to a linked-list node. If node is not the last
node on the list, what is the effect of the following code fragment?

Answer: The current node will now point to the node that is 2 nodes away instead of what it was originally pointed to. Essentially, it points to the next node's next node.


Exercise 5.6 Suppose x is a linked-list Node. What does the following code fragment do?

    t.next = x.next;
    x.next = t;

Answer: t points to the node that x is currently pointing to, and then x changes to point to t.


Exercise 5.7 Why does the following code fragment not do the same thing as the one in Exercise 5.6?
    x.next = t;
    t.next = x.next;

Answer: Because in this case, x points to t first, and so x.next would equal the address of t now. So, t will point back to itself.
