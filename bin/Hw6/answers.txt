1. What output do you get for the following tree traversals?
(a) Preorder 
49 28 18 11 19 40 32 44 83 71 69 72 97 92 99

(b) Inorder 
11 18 19 28 32 40 44 49 69 71 72 83 92 97 99

(d) Postorder
11 19 18 32 44 40 28 69 72 71 92 99 97 83 49


2. What happens if you change the order of the integers in the array keys on line 5 in TestBST.java ? Do you get the same output? Why?

If you change the order, inorder traversal would remain the same, but the other two would be different. This is because in order traversal sorts the BST, so the order doesn't matter. However, for the other two traversals, order does matter.
